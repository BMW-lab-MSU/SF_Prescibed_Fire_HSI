# Attention and Edge-Aware Band Selection for Efficient Hyperspectral Classification of Burned Vegetation  

This repository provides the official implementation of the methods described in our MLSP 2025 paper:  
**"Attention and Edge-Aware Band Selection for Efficient Hyperspectral Classification of Burned Vegetation"**.  
We investigate two complementary hyperspectral band selection methods‚Äî**Spatial-Spectral Edge Preservation (SSEP)** and **Spectral-Redundancy Penalized Attention Ranking (SRPA)**‚Äîfor classifying vegetation in post-burn environments using **VNIR hyperspectral imagery**.

## üî¨ Overview  
Effective post-burn vegetation classification is critical for ecological recovery and wildfire risk assessment.  
Hyperspectral imaging (HSI) offers rich spectral information but suffers from high dimensionality.  
This repository implements:
- **SSEP:** An unsupervised, edge-aware method aligning spectral and label-derived edges.
- **SRPA:** A supervised attention-based method with redundancy penalization for discriminative band selection.
  
Both methods are evaluated using:
- **Random Forest (RF):** Classical spectral-only classifier.
- **Lightweight 3D CNN:** Spatial-spectral deep learning model optimized for efficiency.

## üìä Dataset  
The hyperspectral dataset was collected over a **thin-burn plot (330m √ó 300m)** in the **Lubrecht Experimental Forest (Montana, USA)** using a **Headwall VNIR sensor (273 bands, 400‚Äì1000 nm)**.  
- Labels include **Tree**, **Grass**, and **Soil**, manually annotated from RGB composites derived from hyperspectral bands.
